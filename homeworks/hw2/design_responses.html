						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> When images are placed closer together, it seems as if they've formed groups with each other. When different groups are clearly defined, then it makes it easier on the reader / user. In addition, the myth that users will not scroll intrigued me. I find myself scrolling a lot and it is actually somewhat fun to scroll.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really like the use of images and figures to be able to distinguish between what is not a good example and what is a good example. This really allowed me to take away important concepts. I also like how they used what they taught within the design of the article itself, separating the headers from the paragraphs.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Think you're using too much white space? There's a good chance you're not. If anything, you're probably not using enough. When in doubt, add more and more with space." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
