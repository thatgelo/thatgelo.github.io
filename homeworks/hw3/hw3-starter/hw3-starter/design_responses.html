						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Typography is more than just communicating; it helps to set the mood, tone, and style within a website. Even factors such as audience interests, influence, and age could help decide a font. Pairing fonts is also another good design choice at times.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part is when they give sources that we could use if we want to find more fonts. This helps to expand our horizons and helps us on our search for good typography. It also tells us good ratios we could use, which I never thought existed. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Typography is all about experimentation. It's both a science and an art." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
