					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One thing that I learned is that accessibility is not just an ethical practice, but also a legal practice. In addition, for contrast, it should be at least 4.5:1. Relying solely on color is also a bad practice. When working with others, its best to keep an accessible  color system documentation as well. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really liked how the different points are supported by their reasoning. It tells us why we should include messages with our colors or why we should document our color system. It also gives links to outside sources so we can do more research. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Accounting for accessibility early on in a product's life cycle is best - it reduces the time and money you'll spend to make your products accessible retroactively." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
